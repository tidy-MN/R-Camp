### _1._ Source / Code Editor {-}

Write your scripts and comments here. The is our home and where we spend most of our time. Move your cursor to a line of code and then click <kbd>[Ctrl]</kbd> + <kbd>[Enter]</kbd> to run the code. The tabs at the top show other scripts and data you have open.
</div>

### _3._ Environment / Workspace {-}

This pane shows the data you have loaded, as well as the variables and objects you have created. The History tab contains the code you have run during your current session. Note the **broom** icon below the Connections tab. This cleans shop and clears all of the objects from your workspace.

### _2._ R Console {-}

This is where code is run by the computer. It shows the code that is running and the messages returned by that code. You can input code directly into the console and run it, but it won't be saved for later. We encourage running code from a script in the code editor. 

You may see some _scary_ warnings and errors appear here after running code. __Warnings__ are helpful messages that let you know the results may not be exactly what you expected. __Errors__ on the other hand, mean the code was unable to run. Usually this means there was a typo, or we forgot to run an important step earlier in our script.

### _4._ Plots and files {-}

These tabs allow you to view and open files in your current directory, view plots and other visual objects like maps, view your installed packages, and access the help window. 

The **Files** tab is especially handy for finding files you want and clicking them to open. You can also click the **Gear** and select _"Show Folder in a New Window"_ to open your project folder.
